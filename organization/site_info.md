title: About This Site
---

This site is maintained as github repository and published via github pages. For
information on how to make updates, please see the [README.md file in github](https://github.com/Oregon-Council-of-Computer-Chairs/Oregon-Council-of-Computer-Chairs.github.io).

The prior version of the OCCC website took the form of a [wiki](http://www.occcwiki.org/). All of the up to date
information and historically important records from that site have moved to this site.
However there are some unmaintained resources that were not ported over. In particular, two large collections
of information, both of which have not been updated since at least 2011, exist only on
the old wiki:

* [A collection of pages contributed by memebers with notes covering CS260 related topics](http://www.occcwiki.org/index.php/Contents:_CS2).
* [Curriculum developed as part of trying to introduce a High School Discrete Math course in Oregon](http://www.occcwiki.org/index.php/HS_Discrete_Math_(CS0)).

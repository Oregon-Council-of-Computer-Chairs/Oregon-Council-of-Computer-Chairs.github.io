One of the tasks/goals of the OCCC is the development, maintenance, and coordination of a list of common course numberings. Below is the current list of courses. The following link (a Word document) provides current offerings at each of the Oregon Community Colleges. Course Crosswalk (8/24/2005)

The following list of computer courses has meet the approval of the OCCC. Course numbers ending with the 'x' suffix means that a college may attach their own letter(s) to signify the application or language being taught. The course prefix may also vary slightly, depending on individual college requirements (see note below), but should signify the Computer Science or Computer Information Systems discipline. 200-level courses are considered to have a 100-level course(s) prerequisite.

Courses with a green checkbox - <i class="bi bi-check-square-fill" style="color: green"></i> - have been approved for the "AAOT" and the "Oregon Transfer Module" Science/Mathematics/Computer Science distribution requirement as non-lab science courses. All other courses may be used as general electives. [approved: 10/21/2005]

A definition of Computer Literacy as been approved as the competencies and outcomes specified by the IC3 (Internet and Computing Core Certification). It was also approved that CS/CIS 120 is to be the course that will include these competencies and outcomes. [approved: 10/21/2005]

2003 Agreement on CIS/CS listings

To propose a new number for the OCCC approved common course numbers, see this page:

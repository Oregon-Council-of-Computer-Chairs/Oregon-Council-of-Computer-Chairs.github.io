One of the tasks/goals of the OCCC is the development, maintenance, and coordination of
a [list of common course numberings](common_numbers.md).

To propose a new number for the OCCC approved common course numbers, visit the
[OCCC course number proposal](proposals.md) page. Proposals should be made two months
prior to the next OCCC meeting.

Sample course outlines are available for recently proposed courses on the common numbering
list.

title: CS Course Common Outcomes
---

The Computer Science Major Transfer Map (MTM-CS) promises transferability of the core CS
classes: 160, 161, 162, 205, and 260.  However, the MTM does not define exactly what those
courses look like. To fill this gap, a collection of efforts were undertaken to help institutions
and instructors make sure that students with credits for these classes have the expected knowledge.

## CS 161 / 162 / 260

[CS 161-260 Outcomes]({% link /assets/files/course_outlines/CS_Core.pdf %})

In 2020, the OCCC formed a working group to work on outcomes for CS161/162/260.  
The goal for this project was to provide descriptive information about what is
commonly expected to be covered in this sequence. 

The ordering and location of topics within these three courses often varies depending
on the presence or absence of other courses in the local curriculum, the programming
language used for instruction, and pedagogical preference. Thus, outcomes are not
divided up into specific courses. There is however one block of outcomes that largely
maps onto CS161 & 162, and another block that maps largely onto CS260 (but is usually
started in CS162). These outcomes were developed at a much more granular level than a
typical course outline might contain in an effort to provide clear guidance about expectations.

## CS 160

Work on outcomes for CS160 begun in Fall 2021. To get involved, contact
Andrew Scholer at [ascholer@chemeketa.edu](mailto:ascholer@chemeketa.edu).

## CS205

[CS205 - System Programming and Architecture]({% link assets/files/course_outlines/CS205.pdf %}) - was
developed as part of the Computer Science Major Transfer Map (MTM-CS) to provide a single course within
the MTM acceptable to OSU, PSU and UofO covering the basics of low level computing.

It is a part of the OSU/PSU/UofO variant of the CS-MTM and will fulfill the
necessary requirement of CS201 at PSU or CS271 at OSU. It is also accepted in lieu of the required
CS271 at WOU.

Any offering of CS205 is expected to use the outcomes described in the
[course outline]({% link assets/files/course_outlines/CS205.pdf %}).

OCCC has accepted responsibility for maintaining the course. Any changes to CS205 need to be approved
by the participating institutions to make sure that it continues to fulfil its role within the MTM-CS.
An editable versions of the outline is maintained in the [CS205Outline github repository](https://github.com/Oregon-Council-of-Computer-Chairs/CS205Outline). For access to it, contact a member of the [OCCC
github organization](https://github.com/orgs/Oregon-Council-of-Computer-Chairs/people).

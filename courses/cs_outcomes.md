title: CS Course Common Outcomes
---

The Computer Science Major Transfer Map (MTM-CS) promises transferability of the core CS
classes: 160, 161, 162, 205, and 260.  However, the MTM does not define exactly what those
courses look like. To fill this gap, a collection of efforts were undertaken to help institutions
and instructors make sure that students with credits for these classes have the expected knowledge.

## CS 160

[CS 160 Outcomes]({% link /assets/files/course_outlines/CS160.pdf %})

Work on outcomes for CS160 began in 2021 after completion of the
CS161/162/260 outcomes. A working group created this document to outline
our common beliefs and expectations for what should be covered in a CS160
course within the CS Major Transfer Map. These outcomes were finalized in 2022.

## CS 161 / 162 / 260

[CS 161-260 Outcomes]({% link /assets/files/course_outlines/CS_Core.pdf %})

In 2020, the OCCC formed a working group to work on outcomes for CS161/162/260.  
The goal for this project was to provide descriptive information about what is
commonly expected to be covered in this sequence.

The ordering and location of topics within these three courses often varies depending
on the presence or absence of other courses in the local curriculum, the programming
language used for instruction, and pedagogical preference. Thus, outcomes are not
divided up into specific courses. There is however one block of outcomes that largely
maps onto CS161 & 162, and another block that maps largely onto CS260 (but is usually
started in CS162). These outcomes were developed at a much more granular level than a
typical course outline might contain in an effort to provide clear guidance about expectations.

## CS205

[CS205 - System Programming and Architecture]({% link assets/files/course_outlines/CS205.pdf %}) - was
developed as part of the Computer Science Major Transfer Map (MTM-CS) to provide a single course within
the MTM acceptable to OSU, PSU and UofO covering the basics of low level computing.

It is a part of the OSU/PSU/UofO variant of the CS-MTM and will fulfill a required course at each
institution (PSU: CS201, OSU: CS271, UofO: CIS314). It is also accepted in lieu of the required
CS271 at WOU.

Any offering of CS205 is expected to use the outcomes described in the
[course outline]({% link assets/files/course_outlines/CS205.pdf %}).

OCCC has accepted responsibility for maintaining the course. Any changes to CS205 need to be approved
by the participating institutions to make sure that it continues to fulfil its role within the MTM-CS.
An editable versions of the outline is maintained in the [CS205Outline github repository](https://github.com/Oregon-Council-of-Computer-Chairs/CS205Outline). For access to it, contact a member of the [OCCC
github organization](https://github.com/orgs/Oregon-Council-of-Computer-Chairs/people).

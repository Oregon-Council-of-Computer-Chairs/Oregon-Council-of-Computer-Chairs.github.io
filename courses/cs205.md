[CS205 - System Programming and Architecture]({% link assets/files/course_outlines/CS205.pdf %}) - was
developed as part of the Computer Science Major Transfer Map (MTM-CS) to provide a single course within
the MTM acceptable to OSU, PSU and UofO covering the basics of low level computing.

It is a part of the OSU/PSU/UofO variant of the CS-MTM and will fulfill the
necessary requirement of CS201 at PSU or CS271 at OSU. It is also accepted in lieu of the required
CS271 at WOU.

Any offering of CS205 is expected to use the outcomes described in the
[course outline]({% link assets/files/course_outlines/CS205.pdf %}).

OCCC has accepted responsibility for maintaining the course. Any changes to CS205 need to be approved
by the participating institutions to make sure that it continues to fulfil its role within the MTM-CS.
An editable versions of the outline is maintained in the [CS205Outline github repository](https://github.com/Oregon-Council-of-Computer-Chairs/CS205Outline). For access to it, contact a member of the [OCCC
github organization](https://github.com/orgs/Oregon-Council-of-Computer-Chairs/people).

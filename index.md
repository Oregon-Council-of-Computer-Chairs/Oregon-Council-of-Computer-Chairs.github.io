## Degrees

* [CS Major Transfer Map] (MTM) and  
  [Associate of Science Transfer degree]  (AST)  
  Statewide transfer framework and degree approved in 2021. Provides a pathway for transfer students
  to start Jr year at participating universities with a 2-year pathway to graduation in CS.

* [ASOT - CS]  
  Statewide degree developed in 2014. Provides the same guarantees as the AAOT but also includes math
  and CS courses likely needed to study CS. Largely made obsolete by the MTM and AST degree.
